        "  Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves training a model on a dataset and using that trained model to make predictions or classify new data. It's an exciting technology that enables computers to learn and improve from experience.\n",

        "Facial recognition is all about finding faces in photos using different techniques. There are lots of ways to do this, but it can be hard to tell a face from a bunch of different backgrounds, if it's hidden, or if it's in a bunch of different lighting. This algorithm will be used to identify faces against complicated backgrounds and in different lighting conditions. It could help with surveillance systems that don't let people in, identifying criminals in public places, and even ATM theft.\n",
